# Toronto_Auto_Theft

The objective of this project is to leverage Power BI for data cleaning, ensuring consistency by correcting data types and addressing any corrupted entries.
The focus is on summarizing and analyzing auto-theft data, uncovering insights into neighborhood clusters, property-type distributions, and theft patterns across various timesâ€”such as days of the week and hourly trends.
These insights will allow us to identify patterns and better understand the characteristics of high-theft areas.
The data was obtained from Toronto Police Service Public Safety Portal https://data.torontopolice.on.ca/datasets/TorontoPS::auto-theft-open-data/about

## Methodology

Leveraged Power BI query to correct column data types (transform the data) and employed DAX to incorporate national holidays, summarizing auto-theft trends by day of the year. 
Developed interactive visualizations and ARCGIS maps to effectively present these insights in a clear and engaging manner.
